# GenBucket Plugin

A modular, optimized, and highly configurable GenBucket plugin designed for modern Factions servers. Supports horizontal and vertical generation with advanced control over behavior, restrictions, and performance.

---

## 📦 Module Overview

This project is built using a multi-module Maven structure:

- **api/** – Public-facing API used by external plugins to integrate with GenBucket.
- **core/** – Core internal logic including gen mechanics, validation, and combat checks.
- **plugin/** – Final Spigot plugin module that packages the API and core logic for deployment.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All plugin settings are located in `plugins/GenBucket/config.yml`.

|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `optimize-block-place` | Enables optimized block placing. Disable if errors occur. |
| `disable-in-combat` | Prevents gen placement during combat.                     |

| `clear-drops` | Automatically deletes dropped GenBucket items.            |
| `tick-speed` | Tick delay (5 ticks = 0.25s) between generation steps.    |
| `vertical-switch` | Y-level to determine whether vertical gens go up or down. |
| `use-replace-command` | Allows non-OPs to use `/gb` menu.                         |
