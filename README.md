# GenBucket Plugin

A modular, optimized, and highly configurable GenBucket plugin designed for modern Factions servers. Supports horizontal and vertical generation with advanced control over behavior, restrictions, and performance.

## üì¶ Module Overview

This project is built using a multi-module Maven structure:

- **api/** ‚Äì Public-facing API used by external plugins to integrate with GenBucket.
- **core/** ‚Äì Core internal logic including gen mechanics, validation, and combat checks.
- **plugin/** ‚Äì Final Spigot plugin module that packages the API and core logic for deployment.
